# sokopoker

A simple sökö poker simulator/game with command line interface. 
Sökö rules are close to 5-card stud poker, with additon of two poker hands, flush and straight of four.  

Human player (=You) plays against two computer players Matti and Jussi.
Strategy of computer players is at the moment very simple, improving it is the next step.

Also a nicer QML-based GUI is under planning.

Building the program in Linux OS, with gcc installed:
Go to  Debug folder and type "make sokopoker"
To run the program type "./sokopoker"

Or start a project in Eclipse of similar IDE and build it there.

Main reason for developing this was to refresh and improve my C++ (C++11) programming skills.
